## Splatoon Name String Converter

This simple web tool helps you convert your desired name or text into a UTF-16 (Big Endian) string, formatted specifically for **Splatoon 1**.

Simply type your text into the input field, and the generator will instantly convert it and embed it into a predefined template, filling any remaining space with '00000000'. This ensures the output is ready for direct implementation where these string formats are required.

**Please note:** When using names on **Pretendo Network**, always adhere to their community guidelines. Using **offensive or sexually explicit names** can lead to **bans or exclusions** from the network. Use this tool responsibly!

**Features:**

* **Real-time Conversion:** See the UTF-16 output as you type.
* **UTF-16 (Big Endian):** Converts text to the specific encoding needed.
* **Template Integration:** Automatically inserts your converted text into a pre-structured string, complete with padding.
* **Character Counter:** Keeps track of your input length for convenience.
